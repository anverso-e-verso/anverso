---
The disbeliever walked the moonlit place, \
Outside of gates of hammered serafin, \
Observing the moon-blotches on the walls.

The yellow rocked across the still façades, \
Or else sat spinning on the pinnacles, \
While he imagined humming sounds and sleep.

The walker in the moonlight walked alone, \
And each blank window of the building balked \
His loneliness and what was in his mind:

If in a shimmering room the babies came, \
Drawn close by dreams of fledgling wing, \
It was because night nursed them in its fold.

Night nursed not him in whose dark mind \
The clambering wings of birds of black revolved, \
Making harsh torment of the solitude.

The walker in the moonlight walked alone, \
And in his heart his disbelief lay cold. \
His broad-brimmed hat came close upon his eyes.
