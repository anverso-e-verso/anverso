From a magician’s midnight sleeve \
the radio-singers \
distribute all their love-songs \
over the dew-wet lawns. \
And like a fortune-teller’s \
their marrow-piercing guesses are whatever you believe. \
  \
But on the Navy Yard aerial I find \
better witnesses \
for love on summer nights. \
Five remote red lights \
keep their nests there; Phoenixes \
burning quietly, where the dew cannot climb.
