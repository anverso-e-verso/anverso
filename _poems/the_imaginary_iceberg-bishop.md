---
We’d rather have the iceberg than the ship, \
although it meant the end of travel. \
Although it stood stock-still like cloudy \
rock and all the sea were moving marble. \
We’d rather have the iceberg than the ship; \
we’d rather own this breathing plain of snow \
though the ship’s sails were laid upon the sea \
as the snow lies undissolved upon the water. \
O solemn, floating field, \
are you aware an iceberg takes repose \
with you, and when it wakes may pasture on your snows?

This is a scene a sailor’d give his eyes for. \
The ship’s ignored. The iceberg rises \
and sinks again; its glassy pinnacles \
correct elliptics in the sky. \
This is a scene where he who treads the boards \
is artlessly rhetorical. The curtain \
is light enough to rise on finest ropes \
that airy twists of snow provide. \
The wits of these white peaks \
spar with the sun. \
Its weight the iceberg dares \
upon a shifting stage and stands and stares.

This iceberg cuts its facets from within. \
Like jewelry from a grave \
it saves itself perpetually and adorns \
only itself, perhaps the snows \
which so surprise us lying on the sea. \
Good-bye, we say, good-bye, the ship steers off \
where waves give in to one another’s waves \
and clouds run in a warmer sky. \
Icebergs behoove the soul \
(both being self-made from elements least visible) \
to see them so: fleshed, fair, erected indivisible.
