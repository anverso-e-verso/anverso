To wring words out of one's most wordless states \
bring chaos to a particular order \
of the mind: to mince mind back to brute matter \
the ngrind it to dust, and from this dust bake \
subtle blocks of sound or shape or simply \
space. And what one builds with these blocks, or bricks \
is what one knows cannot be reached or caught \
but only built: the thing that shies away, \
of its own will; the thing that shies away, \
that won't be killed or shooed back into a space \
it very likely never filled; the thing \
that can't be looked in the face, yet can gaze \
quite fixedly into one's eyes; the thing \
that lies behind it all — or so one thinks.
