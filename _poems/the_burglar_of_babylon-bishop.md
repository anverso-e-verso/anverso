On the fair green hills of Rio \
There grows a fearful stain: \
The poor who come to Rio \
And can’t go home again.

On the hills a million people, \
A million sparrows, nest, \
Like a confused migration \
That’s had to light and rest,

Building its nests, or houses, \
Out of nothing at all, or air. \
You’d think a breath would end them, \
They perch so lightly there.

But they cling and spread like lichen, \
And the people come and come. \
There’s one hill called the Chicken, \
And one called Catacomb;

There’s the hill of Kerosene, \
And the hill of the Skeleton, \
The hill of Astonishment, \
And the hill of Babylon.

Micuçú was a burglar and killer, \
An enemy of society. \
He had escaped three times \
From the worst penitentiary.

They don’t know how many he murdered \
(Though they say he never raped), \
And he wounded two policemen \
This last time he escaped.

They said, “He’ll go to his auntie, \
Who raised him like a son. \
She has a little drink shop \
On the hill of Babylon”.

He did go straight to his auntie, \
And he drank a final beer. \
He told her, “The soldiers are coming, \
And I’ve got to disappear.

“Ninety years they gave me. \
Who wants to live that long? \
I’ll settle for ninety hours, \
On the hill of Babylon.

“Don’t tell anyone you saw me. \
I’ll run as long as I can. \
You were good to me, and I love you, \
But I’m a doomed man.”

Going out, he met a mulata \
Carrying water on her head. \
“If you say you saw me, daughter, \
You’re just as good as dead.”

There are caves up there, and hideouts, \
And an old fort, falling down. \
They used to watch for Frenchmen \
From the hill of Babylon.

Below him was the ocean. \
It reached far up the sky, \
Flat as a wall, and on it \
Were freighters passing by,

Or climbing the wall, and climbing \
Till each looked like a fly, \
And then fell over and vanished; \
And he knew he was going to die.

He could hear the goats baa-baa-ing, \
He could hear the babies cry; \
Fluttering kites strained upward; \
And he knew he was going to die.

A buzzard flapped so near him \
He could see its naked neck. \
He waved his arms and shouted, \
“Not yet, my son, not yet!”

An Army helicopter \
Came nosing around and in. \
He could see two men inside it, \
But they never spotted him.

The soldiers were all over, \
On all sides of the hill, \
And right against the skyline \
A row of them, small and still.

Children peeked out of windows, \
And men in the drink shop swore, \
And spat a little cachaça \
At the light cracks in the floor.

But the soldiers were nervous, even \
With tommy guns in hand, \
And one of them, in a panic, \
Shot the officer in command.

He hit him in three places; \
The other shots went wild. \
The soldier had hysterics \
And sobbed like a little child.

The dying man said, “Finish \
The job we came here for”. \
He committed his soul to God \
And his sons to the Governor.

They ran and got a priest, \
And he died in hope of Heaven \
– A man from Pernambuco, \
The youngest of eleven.

They wanted to stop the search, \
But the Army said. “No, go on”, \
So the soldiers swarmed again \
Up the hill of Babylon.

Rich people in apartments \
Watched through binoculars \
As long as the daylight lasted. \
And all night, under the stars,

Micuçú hid in the grasses \
Or sat in a little tree, \
Listening for sounds, and staring \
At the lighthouse out at sea.

And the lighthouse stared back at him, \
Till finally it was dawn. \
He was soaked with dew, and hungry, \
On the hill of Babylon.

The yellow sun was ugly, \
Like a raw egg on a plate – \
Slick from the sea. He cursed it, \
For he knew it sealed his fate.

He saw the long white beaches \
And people going to swim, \
With towels and beach umbrellas, \
But the soldiers were after him.

Far, far below, the people \
Were little colored spots, \
And the heads of those in swimming \
Were floating coconuts.

He heard the peanut vendor \
Go peep-peep on his whistle, \
And the man that sells umbrellas \
Swinging his watchman’s rattle.

Women with market baskets \
Stood on the corners and talked, \
Then went on their way to market, \
Gazing up as they walked.

The rich with their binoculars \
Were back again, and many \
Were standing on the rooftops, \
Among TV antennae.

It was early, eight or eight-thirty. \
He saw a soldier climb, \
Looking right at him. He fired, \
And missed for the last time.

He could hear the soldier panting, \
Though he never got very near. \
Micuçú dashed for shelter. \
But he got it, behind the ear.

He heard the babies crying \
Far, far away in his head, \
And the mongrels barking and barking. \
Then Micuçú was dead.

He had a Taurus revolver, \
And just the clothes he had on, \
With two contos in the pockets, \
On the hill of Babylon.

The police and the populace \
Heaved a sigh of relief, \
But behind the counter his auntie \
Wiped her eyes in grief.

“We have always been respected. \
My shop is honest and clean. \
I loved him, but from a baby \
Micuçú was always mean.

“We have always been respected. \
His sister has a job. \
Both of us gave him money. \
Why did he have to rob?

“I raised him to be honest, \
Even here, in Babylon slum”. \
The customers had another, \
Looking serious and glum.

But one of them said to another, \
When he got outside the door, \
“He wasn’t much of a burglar, \
He got caught six times – or more”.

This morning the little soldiers \
Are on Babylon hill again; \
Their gun barrels and helmets \
Shine in a gentle rain

Micuçú is buried already. \
They’re after another two, \
But they say they aren’t dangerous \
As the poor Micuçú.

On the fair green hills of Rio \
There grows a fearful stain: \
The poor who come to Rio \
And can’t go home again.

There’s the hill of Kerosene, \
And the hill of the Skeleton, \
The hill of Astonishment, \
And the hill of Babylon.
