# I

In that November off Tehuantepec, \
The slopping of the sea grew still one night \
And in the morning summer hued the deck

And made one think of rosy chocolate \
And gilt umbrellas. Paradisal green \
Gave suavity to the perplexed machine

Of ocean, which like limpid water lay. \
Who, then, in that ambrosial latitude \
Out of the light evolved the morning blooms,

Who, then, evolved the sea-blooms from the clouds \
Diffusing balm in that Pacific calm? \
_C'etait mon enfant, mon bijou, mon ame._

The sea-clouds whitened far below the calm \
And moved, as blooms move, in the swimming green \
And in its watery radiance, while the hue

Of heaven in an antique reflection rolled \
Round those flotillas. And sometimes the sea \
Poured brilliant iris on the glistening blue.

# II

In that November off Tehuantepec \
The slopping of the sea grew still one night. \
At breakfast jelly yellow streaked the deck

And made one think of chop-house chocolate \
And sham umbrellas. And a sham-like green \
Capped summer-seeming on the tense machine

Of ocean, which in sinister flatness lay. \
Who, then, beheld the rising of the clouds \
That strode submerged in that malevolent sheen,

Who saw the mortal massives of the blooms \
Of water moving on the water-floor? \
_C'etait mon frere du ciel, ma vie, mon or._

The gongs rang loudly as the windy booms \
Hoo-hooed it in the darkened ocean-blooms. \
The gongs grew still. And then blue heaven spread

Its crystalline pendentives on the sea \
And the macabre of the water-glooms \
In an enormous undulation fled.

# III

In that November off Tehuantepec, \
The slopping of the sea grew still one night \
And a pale silver patterned on the deck

And made one think of porcelain chocolate \
And pied umbrellas. An uncertain green, \
Piano-polished, held the tranced machine

Of ocean, as a prelude holds and holds, \
Who, seeing silver petals of white blooms \
Unfolding in the water, feeling sure

Of the milk within the saltiest spurge, heard, then, \
The sea unfolding in the sunken clouds? \
_Oh! C'etait mon extase et mon amour._

So deeply sunken were they that the shrouds, \
The shrouding shadows, made the petals black \
Until the rolling heaven made them blue,

A blue beyond the rainy hyacinth, \
And smiting the crevasses of the leaves \
Deluged the ocean with a sapphire blue.

# IV

In that November off Tehuantepec \
The night-long slopping of the sea grew still. \
A mallow morning dozed upon the deck

And made one think of musky chocolate \
And frail umbrellas. A too-fluent green \
Suggested malice in the dry machine

Of ocean, pondering dank stratagem. \
Who then beheld the figures of the clouds \
Like blooms secluded in the thick marine?

Like blooms? Like damasks that were shaken off \
From the loosed girdles in the spangling must. \
_C'etait ma foi, la nonchalance divine._

The nakedness would rise and suddenly turn \
Salt masks of beard and mouths of bellowing, \
Would--But more suddenly the heaven rolled

Its bluest sea-clouds in the thinking green, \
And the nakedness became the broadest blooms, \
Mile-mallows that a mallow sun cajoled.

# V

In that November off Tehuantepec \
Night stilled the slopping of the sea. \
The day came, bowing and voluble, upon the deck,

Good clown... One thought of Chinese chocolate \
And large umbrellas. And a motley green \
Followed the drift of the obese machine

Of ocean, perfected in indolence. \
What pistache one, ingenious and droll, \
Beheld the sovereign clouds as jugglery

And the sea as turquoise-turbaned, neat \
At tossing saucers--cloudy-conjuring sea? \
_C'etait mon esprit batard, l'ignominie._

The sovereign clouds came clustering. The conch \
Of loyal conjuration. The wind \
Of green blooms turning crisped the motley hue

To clearing opalescence. Then the sea \
And heaven rolled as one and from the two \
Came fresh transfigurings of freshest blue.
