1\.

You die when your spirit dies. \
Otherwise, you live. \
You may not do a good job of it, but you go on — \
something you have no choice about.

When I tell this to my children \
they pay no attention. \
The old people, they think — \
this is what they always do: \
talk about things no one can see \
to cover up all the brain cells they’re losing. \
They wink at each other; \
listen to the old one, talking about the spirit \
because he can’t remember anymore the word for chair.

It is terrible to be alone. \
I don’t mean to live alone — \
to _be_ alone, where no one hears you.

I remember the word for chair. \
I want to say — I’m just not interested anymore.

I wake up thinking \
_you have to prepare_. \
Soon the spirit will give up — \
all the chairs in the world won’t help you.

I know what they say when I’m out of the room. \
Should I be seeing someone, should I be taking \
one of the new drugs for depression. \
I can hear them, in whispers, planning how to divide the cost.

And I want to scream out \
_you’re all of you living in a dream_.

Bad enough, they think, to watch me fall apart. \
Bad enough without this lecturing they get these days \
as though I had any right to this new information.

Well, they have the same right.

They’re living in a dream, and I’m preparing \
to be a ghost. I want to shout out

_the mist has cleared_ — \
It’s like some new life: \
you have no stake in the outcome; \
you know the outcome.

Think of it: sixty years sitting in chairs. And now the mortal spirit \
seeking so openly, so fearlessly —

To raise the veil. \
To see what you’re saying goodbye to.

I didn’t go back for a long time. \
When I saw the field again, autumn was finished. \
Here, it finishes almost before it starts — \
the old people don’t even own summer clothing.

The field was covered with snow, immaculate. \
There wasn’t a sign of what happened here. \
You didn’t know whether the farmer \
had replanted or not. \
Maybe he gave up and moved away.

The police didn’t catch the girl. \
After awhile they said she moved to some other country, \
one where  they don’t have fields.

A disaster like this \
leaves no mark on the earth. \
And people like that — they think it gives them \
a fresh start.

I stood a long time, staring at nothing. \
After a bit, I noticed how dark it was, how cold.

A long time — I have no idea how long. \
Once the earth decides to have no memory \
time seems in a way meaningless.

But not to my children. They’re after me \
to make a will; they’re worried the government \
will take everything.

They should come with me sometime \
to look at this field under the cover of snow. \
The whole thing is written out there.

Nothing: I have nothing to give them.

That’s the first. \
The second is: I don’t want to be burned.

On one side, the soul wanders. \
On the other, human beings living in fear. \
In between, the pit of disappearance.

Some young girls ask me \
if they’ll be safe near Averno — \
they’re cold, they want to go south a little while. \
And one says, like a joke, but not too far south —

I say, as safe as anywhere, \
which makes them happy. \
What it means is nothing is safe.

You get on a train, you disappear. \
You write your name on the window, you disappear.

There are places like this everywhere, \
places you enter as a young girl \
from which you never return.

Like the field, the one that burned. \
Afterward, the girl was gone. \
Maybe she didn’t exist, \
we have no proof either way.

All we know is: \
the field burned. \
But we _saw_ that.

So we have to believe in the girl, \
in what she did. Otherwise \
it’s just forces we don’t understand \
ruling the earth.

The girls are happy, thinking of their vacation. \
Don’t take a train, I say.

They write their names in mist on a train window. \
I want to say, you’re good girls, \
trying to leave your names behind.

We spent the whole day \
sailing the archipelago, \
the tiny islands that were \
part of the penisula

until they’d broken off \
into the fragments you see now \
floating in the northern sea water.

They seemed safe to me, \
I think because no one can live there.

Later we sat in the kitchen \
watching the evening start and then the snow. \
First one, then the other.

We grew silent, hypnotized by the snow \
as though a kind of tubulence \
that had been hidden before \
was becoming visible,

something within the night \
exposed now —

In our silence, we were asking \
those questions friends who trust each other \
ask out of great fatigue, \
each one hoping the other knows more

and when this isn’t so, hoping \
their shared impressions will amount to insight.

_Is there any benefit in forcing upon oneself_ \
_the realization that one must die?_ \
_Is it possible to miss the opportunity of one’s life?_

Questions like that.

The snow was heavy. The black night \
transformed into busy white air.

Something we hadn’t seen revealed. \
Only the meaning wasn’t revealed.

After the first winter, the field began to grow again. \
But there were no more orderly furrows. \
The smell of the wheat persisted, a kind of random aroma \
intermixed with various weeds, for which \
no human use has been as yet devised.

It was puzzling —  no one knew \
where the farmer had gone. \
Some people thought he died. \
Someone said he had a daughter in New Zealand, \
that he went there to raise \
grandchildren instead of wheat.

Nature, it turns out, isn’t like us; \
it doesn’t have a warehouse of memory. \
The field doesn’t become afraid of matches, \
of young girls. It doesn’t remember \
furrows either. It gets killed off, it gets burned, \
and a year later it’s alive again \
as though nothing unusual has occured.

The farmer stares out the window. \
Maybe in New Zealand, maybe somewhere else. \
And he thinks: _my life is over_. \
His life expressed  itself in that field; \
he doesn’t believe anymore in making anything \
out of earth. The earth, he thinks, \
has overpowered me.

He remembers the day the field burned, \
not, he thinks, by accident. \
Something deep within him said: _I can live with this,_ \
_I can fight it after awhile_.

The terrible moment was the spring after his work was erased, \
when he understood that the earth \
didn’t know how to mourn, that it would change instead. \
And then go on existing without him.
