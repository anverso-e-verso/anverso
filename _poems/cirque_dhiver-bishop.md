Across the floor flits the mechanical toy, \
fit for a king of several centuries back. \
A little circus horse with real white hair. \
His eyes are glossy black. \
He bears a little dancer on his back.

She stands upon her toes and turns and turns. \
A slanting spray of artificial roses \
is stitched across her skirt and tinsel bodice. \
Above her head she poses \
another spray of artificial roses.

His mane and tail are straight from Chirico. \
He has a formal, melancholy soul. \
He feels her pink toes dangle toward his back \
along the little pole \
that pierces both her body and her soul

and goes through his, and reappears below, \
under his belly, as a big tin key. \
He canters three steps, then he makes a bow, \
canters again, bows on one knee, \
canters, then clicks and stops, and looks at me.

The dancer, by this time, has turned her back. \
He is the more intelligent by far. \
Facing each other rather desperately— \
his eye is like a star— \
we stare and say, “Well, we have come this far.”
