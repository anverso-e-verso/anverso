There was a war between good and evil. \
We decided to call the body good.

That made death evil. \
It turned the soul \
against death completely.

Like a foot soldier wanting \
to serve a great warrior, the soul \
wanted to side with the body.

It turned against the dark, \
against the forms of death \
it recognized.

Where does the voice come from \
that says suppose the war \
is evil, that says

suppose the body did this to us, \
made us afraid of love–
