It’s very dark today; through the rain, \
the mountain isn’t visible. The only sound \
is rain, driving life underground. \
And with the rain, cold comes. \
There will be no moon tonight, no stars.

The wind rose at night, \
all morning it lashed against the wheat— \
at noon it ended. But the storm went on, \
soaking the dry fields, then flooding them—

The earth has vanished. \
There’s nothing to see, only the rain \
gleaming against the dark windows. \
This is the resting place, where nothing moves—

Now we return to what we were, \
animals living in darkness \
without language or vision—

Nothing proves I’m alive. \
There is only the rain, the rain is endless.
