The moon in the bureau mirror \
looks out a million miles \
(and perhaps with pride, at herself, \
but she never, never smiles) \
far and away beyond sleep, or \
perhaps she's a daytime sleeper.

By the Universe deserted, \
she'd tell it to go to hell, \
and she'd find a body of water, \
or a mirror, on which to dwell. \
So wrap up care in a cobweb \
and drop it down the well

into that world inverted \
where left is always right, \
where the shadows are really the body, \
where we stay awake all night, \
where the heavens are shallow as the sea \
is now deep, and you love me.
