The still explosions on the rocks, \
the lichens, grow \
by spreading gray, concentric shocks. \
They have arranged \
to meet the rings around the moon, although \
within our memories they have not changed.

And since the heavens will attend \
as long on us, \
you've been, dear friend, \
precipitate and pragmatical; \
and look what happens.  For Time is    \
nothing if not amenable.

The shooting stars in your black hair \
in bright formation \
are flocking where, \
so straight, so soon? \
– Come, let me wash it in this big tin basin, \
battered and shiny like the moon.
