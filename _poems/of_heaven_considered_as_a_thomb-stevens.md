What word have you, interpreters, of men \
Who in the tomb of heaven walk by night, \
The darkened ghosts of our old comedy? \
Do they believe they range the gusty cold, \
With lanterns borne aloft to light the way, \
Freemen of death, about and still about \
To find whatever it is they seek? Or does \
That burial, pillared up each day as porte \
And spiritous passage into nothingness, \
Foretell each night the one abysmal night, \
When the host shall no more wander, nor the light \
Of the steadfast lanterns creep across the dark? \
Make hue among the dark comedians, \
Halloo them in the topmost distances \
For answer from their icy Elysée.
