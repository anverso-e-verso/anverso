---

I dreamed that dead, and meditating, \
I lay upon a grave, or bed, \
(at least, some cold and close-built bower). \
In the cold heart, its final thought \
stood frozen, drawn immense and clear, \
stiff and idle as I was there; \
and we remained unchanged together \
for a year, a minute, an hour. \
Suddenly there was a motion, \
as startling, there, to every sense \
as an explosion. Then it dropped \
to insistent, cautious creeping \
in the region of the heart, \
prodding me from desperate sleep. \
I raised my head. A slight young weed \
had pushed up through the heart and its \
green head was nodding on the breast. \
(All this was in the dark.) \
It grew an inch like a blade of grass; \
next, one leaf shot out of its side \
a twisting, waving flag, and then \
two leaves moved like a semaphore. \
The stem grew thick. The nervous roots \
reached to each side; the graceful head \
changed its position mysteriously, \
since there was neither sun nor moon \
to catch its young attention. \
The rooted heart began to change \
(not beat) and then it split apart \
and from it broke a flood of water. \
Two rivers glanced off from the sides, \
one to the right, one to the left, \
two rushing, half-clear streams, \
(the ribs made of them two cascades) \
which assuredly, smooth as glass, \
went off through the fine black grains of earth. \
The weed was almost swept away; \
it struggled with its leaves, \
lifting them fringed with heavy drops. \
A few drops fell upon my face \
and in my eyes, so I could see \
(or, in that black place, thought I saw) \
that each drop contained a light, \
a small, illuminated scene; \
the weed-deflected stream was made \
itself of racing images. \
(As if a river should carry all \
the scenes that it had once reflected \
shut in its waters, and not floating \
on momentary surfaces.) \
The weed stood in the severed heart. \
"What are you doing there?" I asked. \
It lifted its head all dripping wet \
(with my own thoughts?) \
and answered then: "I grow," it said, \
"but to divide your heart again."
