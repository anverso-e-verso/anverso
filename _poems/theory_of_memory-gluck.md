---
Long, long ago, before I was a tormented artist, afflicted with longing yet \
incapable of forming durable attachments, long before this, I was a glorious \
ruler uniting all of a divided country—so I was told by the fortune-teller \
who examined my palm. Great things, she said, are ahead of you, or perhaps \
behind you; it is difficult to be sure. And yet, she added, what is the difference? \
Right now you are a child holding hands with a fortune-teller. All the \
rest is hypothesis and dream.
